    <h2> What is Containerization</h2>
    <img src="images/containerization.png" width="1180px" height="400px"/>
    <p>Application containerization allows businesses to launch individual applications without the need to rent an entire VM. It does this by “virtualizing” an operating system and giving containers access to a single operating system kernel – each container comprising the application and the software required for the application to run (settings, libraries, storage, etc.).

      The process of application containerization allows multiple applications to be distributed across a single host operating system without requiring their own VM, which can lead to significant cost savings. Whereas previously, a server hosting eight applications in eight VMs would have eight copies of the operating system running in each VM, ten containers can share the same operating system.

      In addition to significant cost savings, application containerization allows for greater portability. This can accelerate the process of testing applications across different operating systems because there is no waiting for the operating system to boot up. Furthermore, if the application crashes during testing, it only takes down the isolated container rather than the entire operating system.

      One further benefit of application containerization is that containers can be clustered together for easy scalability or to work together as micro-services. In the latter case, if an application requires updating or replacing, it can be done in isolation of other applications and without the need to stop the entire service. The lower costs, greater portability and minimal downtime are three reasons why application containerization has
      become more than just a new buzzword in cloud computing and is changing the way in which resources are deployed into the cloud. </p>
    <p>Containerization is a major trend in software development and is its adoption will likely grow in both magnitude and speed. Large players like Google and IBM are making big bets on containerization. Additionally, an enormous startup ecosystem is forming to enable containerization.

      Containerization’s proponents believe that it allows developers to create and deploy applications faster and more securely than traditional methods. While containerization is expensive, its costs are expected to fall significantly as containerization environments develop and mature. Containerization is thus
      likely to become the new norm for software development.</p>
